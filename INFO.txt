** DevTools with Spring Boot **

Add following to pom.xml ->

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
		</dependency>

Access H2 console as follows ->

http://localhost:8080/h2-console/

Use JDBC URL as follows when you define database name = "apples"

   jdbc:h2:mem:apples

Eg: application.yml as follows

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:apples;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password:
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    platform: h2

Enable Console (IF NOT USING DEVTOOLS if you are as per #1 above no need) ->

Note: If you are not using Spring Boot’s developer tools, but would still like to make use of H2’s console, then you
can do so by configuring the spring.h2.console.enabled property with a value of true. The H2 console is only intended
for use during development so care should be taken to ensure that spring.h2.console.enabled is not set to true in production.

application.yml:

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:apples;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
    username: sa
    password:
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
    platform: h2

  # enable H2 web console and set url for web console
  # http://localhost:8080/console
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true
      path: /console

Disbale cache of Thymleaf pages if NOT USING DEVTOOLS ->

spring.thymeleaf.cache
